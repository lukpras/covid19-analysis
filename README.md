## Dataset
https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus

## SQL Querying and Visualization
-Microsoft SQL Server for querying.  
-Tableau Public for visualization.  
-I'm separating the data into 2 tables because try using join  
-Can check the dashboard in here https://lukpras.github.io/covid19-analysis/  
-U can use tableau pro for querying directly from database, so no need to save queries as CSV or TXT
